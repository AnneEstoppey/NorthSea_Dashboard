## Interactive Dashboard, Norwegian Continental Shelf Oil&Gas Production - 1971 to 2023
Direct live link to Dashboard: https://northseadashboard.streamlit.app/

The goal of creating this dashboard was to work with production data directly from the downloaded files (.csv and shapefiles), and visualize the field production through the years.<br>
We also wished to experiment with additional elements like a donut graph, and some more advanced table visualization. We hope you like it!<br>

With the slider, the user can move through the years and select years 1971 to 2023 with increment of 5 years.

Hovering close to the data points or field outlines will show popups with more detailed information.

Production units are mill Sm3 OE (million Standard cubic meters Oil Equivanlent).

The outlines of the fields are from December 2023.
